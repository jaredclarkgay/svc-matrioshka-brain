When I wake in the morning  
Feeling just like dirt  
(If I remembered that what felt like)  
I throw on my jumpsuit  
And get ready for work  

I'm just an inconsequential crewman  
Although I give it my best  
After years and years of working  
No one seems to know I exist  

Ah ya'll, ya'll there  
ya'll know what I'm saying - uh -
We don't get know love  

If you're from engineers  
Put your hands in the air  
For my engineers  
If you just don't care and you're engineers  
Put your hands in the air  
Engineers!! Engineersss!!!  
When I say engine, you say ears!  
Engine - eers. Engine - eers.  

Hands in the air for the medical  
Hands in the air for the medical  
I say medi- CAL medi-CAL!  

Well I got something to tell ya'll  
That you may not know  
Sometimes you matter more  
Than you think when you're living down here below  
On the lower decks  
Where they don't pay  
And they don't cash checks  
But you know what?  
You matter to me! So sing along!  

We're all consequential crewmen  
When it matters most  
Cuz without us, this ship would sink  
And the whole planet earth would be toast  

Because we're all consequential crewmen  
Throw your hands in the air with me if you agree  
And hug the person sitting next to you  
They might be the last one you ever see  

Yes we're all consequential crewmen  
You all do your jobs so well  
So get back to work immediately  
Before planet Earth goes to hell
