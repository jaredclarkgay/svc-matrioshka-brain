Em-Dm
When I wake in the morning  
Feeling just like dirt  
I throw on my jumpsuit  
And get ready for work  -Am!

So I walk to my station
I work there all alone
Monitoring radiation
and Staring deep into black holes

C-Em/B-Am7-C/G-F-G(-C on last one)  
(i'm just an) 
Inconsequential crewman  
And though I give it my best  
How much can I really matter,
When no one seems to know I exist?

Happy chords G6 G F6 F

Well I have a little secret- back on earth i was a party dude 2 da max
Watch me get this crowd hyped
You all listening?
When I say "this" you "that"
THIS
(THAT)
THIS
(THAT)

Yeah you get it

When I say "Outer" you say "Space"
rocket-ship
extra-terrestrials
max-warp
uni-verse
solar-system
planet-inhabitable
Ex-plore

Put your hands in the air  
Cuz your engineers  
Hands in the air cuz you're engineers!  
Hands in the air cuz you're engineers!  
Hands in the air cuz you're engineers!  

Well I got something to tell you all  
That you may not know  
Without us all doing our part  
The ship would probably explode (KEY CHANGE!!!)  

D-F#m-
We're all consequential crewmen!!!  
We always give it our best!!!!
Without everybody's efforts
The SVC couldn't exist!

Slow outro

(tom - I guess what we're trying to say is there's a lot going on behind the scenes, and we're all excited to be on this mission!)

(Jared - You're the best crew a captain could ever ask for.)
