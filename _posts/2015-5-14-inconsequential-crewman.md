Em-Dm
When I wake in the morning  
Feeling just like dirt  
I throw on my jumpsuit  
And get ready for work  

verse 2x

C-Em/B-Am7-C/G-F-G(-C on last one)  
I'm just an inconsequential crewman  
And though I give it my best  
I sit here next to the captain    
But he doesn't seem to know I exist  

Yeah everybody out here in the crew  
Knows what I'm talking about, right?!!  
Yeah we don't get no love  
From the big shots up above  
We've all been there before  
We just do our chores  
And no one seems to notice  
But that's how it goees  
On the lower decks  
Yo where's the respect? (Goad the crowd before moving on)  

So we're gonna do a little call and response here
When I say "this" you "that"
THIS
(THAT)
THIS
(THAT)

Yeah you get it

When I say "Outer" you say "Space"
rocket-ship
extra-terrestrials
max-warp
uni-verse
solar-system
planet-inhabitable
Ex-plore

Put your hands in the air  
Cuz your engineers  
Hands in the air cuz you're engineers!  
Hands in the air cuz you're engineers!  
Hands in the air cuz you're engineers!  

Well I got something to tell you all  
That you may not know  
Without us all doing our part  
The ship would probably explode (KEY CHANGE!!!)  

D-F#m-
We're all consequential crewmen!!!  
We always give it our best!!!!
Without everybody's efforts
The SVC couldn't exist!

Slow outro

(tom - I guess what we're trying to say is there's a lot going on behind the scenes, and we're all excited to be on this mission!)

(Jared - You're the best crew a captain could ever ask for.)
