- Jared: Can I get a report from the crew? How are you all out there? Everyone up here? Ben? Sab? Andrew? Kyle? Tom? -  
- Tom: Everything is going great! And nice to meet you everyone, I'm the ship's Chief Engineer, Tom! Here's my official engineering report: We are currently traveling steadily at 10 times the speed of light. And I've noticed some irregularities in our warp field, but I think we're okay. -  
- Jared: You think we're okay? -  
- Tom: You know captain, nothing's ever going to be perfect. But we've got an excellent crew, and I'm confident our crew can handle whatever the icy void of space throws at us. Furthermore, and FURTHERMORE, I'm proud to be here with you and the rest of this crew looking for life out there. I mean, being here with all of you as part of the SVC, I'm living my lifelong dream. -  

Em-Dm  
Here on the Starship Fermi  
We've all got a dream  
To find life in outer space  
(That's why we) joined the SVC  
Am!  
G-F  
The future is a mystery  
That we're hoping to solve  
We've got our responsibilities  
All gotta do our jobs  

C-Em/B-Am7-C/G-F-G(-C on last one)  
Cuz my life is in your hands  
And your life's here in mine  
If we all work together  
We're all gonna be just fine  
Who knows what we might find?  

Something's on my monitor  
It seems the engines have stopped  
As the ship's chief engineer  
I need every hand on deck  

Ohhoohhh breakdown  

I think I see what's happening  
The vortex coupling has slipped  
Let's put this thing together  
Let's Save our Ship!  

Chorus  

Ohh's again  

I think it's working...
