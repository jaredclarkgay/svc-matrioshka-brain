title: 1-2) Boarding & Takeoff

To-do: 


This first recording would be better for the intro.

This second recording is what I think the actualy launch/floating might work really well as.

Trumpet plays slow, half-time of takeoff theme. A voice comes on and says:

Thank you for joining the crew of The Starship Mercury. We've been preparing this mission for years, and now, finally we can take a full crew beyond the speed of light through the ocean of stars, and to many new worlds.

Those who have gone at this speed before haven't had the extensive crew and scientific research capabilities that our ship of exploration now employs.

What you just heard are the engines preparing to break us free from gravity's bounds.

Is everyone safely fastened into their seats? Is everyone prepared to leave the earth? Is everyone prepared to leave the solar system? Is everyone prepared to leave our galaxy????

Well let's go then. Welcome to the ship. Prepare for liftoff.


SONG lyrics are all about how we're in space to explore it - send them to Colin.
