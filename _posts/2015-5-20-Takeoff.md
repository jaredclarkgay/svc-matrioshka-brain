Good evening folks. Tonight I am your captain. You can call me Captain Jared Gay. Myself, along with the crew you see here beside me, will be taking you beyond the limits of our known galaxy. And tonight - you are also part of the crew. So who here is ready to go to space?  

First things first - this is a science vessel. We are explorers. The whole point of this trip is to discover new life, study it, and hopefully learn something about ourselves in the process.  

What you just heard are the engines preparing to blast us off the Earth.

Is everyone safely fastened? Is everyone prepared to leave the planet? Is everyone prepared to leave their jobs and families back home? Is everyone prepared for outer space????

Well let's go then. Welcome to the ship. Prepare for liftoff.


## Takeoff lyrics

Look out your window  
say goodbye  
to the earth   
as you take flight  

You're passing quickly  
through the sky  
say hello  
to the night  

Vibrating like a tuning fork  
Your body shakes back and forth  
Blasting off the fuel combusts  
The pressure has you nearly crushed  

What did I sign up for?  
What does our future hold?  
The one certainty I know  
(is that) Outer space is cold  
Outer space is cold  

We're going off to places where   
we have no history  
Outer space above all else  
Is a mystery  
What's it gonna be?  
What's it gonna be?  

Is life out there?  
Are we going to find it?  
Are we entering a place  
We weren't invited?  

Whatever lies ahead  
Is Earth's newest beginning  
Nothing will quite be the same  
As I think I'm hardly breathing  

No oxygen
No sound at all
Just darkness
And endless stars

No gravity
No atmosphere
Just our crew
And the night
