## 1 Boarding the ship

Good evening folks. Tonight I am your captain. You can call me Captain Jared Gay. Myself, along with the crew you see here beside me, will be taking you beyond the limits of our known galaxy. And tonight - you are part of our crew. So who here is ready to go to space?  

First things first - this ship we're on is the FIRST ship to take a full crew beyond the speed of light. Our primary mission is to find other intelligent life. It is time we find out whether or not we're really alone out here.

What you just heard are the engines preparing to blast us off the Earth. We'll soon be speeding towards a planet we have long suspected is either habitable, or already hosts life. We call the planet ______.

Is everyone safely fastened? Is everyone prepared to leave the planet? Is everyone prepared to leave their jobs and families outside those doors? Is everyone prepared for outer space????

Well let's go then. Welcome to the ship. Prepare for liftoff.


## 2 Takeoff

Look out your window  
say goodbye  
You're passing quickly through the night  

Goodbye to lovers  
Oh, there's no cure  
You're already miles from the Earth  
 
Vibrating like a tuning fork  
Your body shakes back and forth  
Blasting off the fuel combusts  
The pressure has you nearly crushed  
 
What did I sign up for?  
What does our future hold?  
The only thing I know right now  
It's getting c-c-c-c-c-cold  

Hurling off to the only place left  
That we've never seen  
Just have the crudest guess  
What it's gonna be  

Is life out there?  
Are we going to find it?  
Are we just crashing a party  
When we weren't invited?  

Vibrating like a tuning fork  
Your body shakes back and forth  
Blasting off the fuel combusts  
I've got my doubts, I've got my trust.  

Whatever lies ahead  
Our newest beginning  
Nothing will be quite the same  
Will something  be ending?  

No oxygen  
No sound at all  
Just darkness  
And endless stars  

No gravity  
No atmosphere  
Just our crew and the night  
And a hope, and a hope  
To find some light  


## 3 Floating

I see the space in front of me  
Through some glass a few feet deep  

Days go by it looks the same  
Each passing star a nameless grain  

I keep a picture within reach  
of my friends and family  
I wonder what they're wondering  
As I float through the spacey deep  

Don’t be alarmed  
The space isn’t so far  
Between  
Point A  
And Point B  
I came here to reach beyond our  
Earth and through the stars  
I came here to reach beyond our  
Earth and through the stars  

I won't ever see  
Things the way they used to be  
We're the first to take this leap  
Deep into the galaxy  

I am wonderin’ what we’ll see  
I hope there’s life out there like me


## 4 Inconsequential Crewman

(Dialogue)  
Colin: Sir. The ship's engines have shut off. All vital systems are functional, but the engines won't run. We're dead in the water. I mean, we're floating - extremely fast - but also, it'll take us 5,000 years to reach _____planet unless we can get the engines back on. 
Jared: Well. That's a problem. Who in the audience are engineers? And where are my science officers? Do any of you have any idea how we can get ourselves moving?  
Tom: Uh.. I have an idea.  
Jared: Tom!! Tell us!  
Tom: You know my name??  
Jared: Of course I know your name! I know the name of every crew member on the ship. There's Megan! And Mark! Timon! Cassandra!  
Tom: Wow! You really do know everyone on the ship! Well. I know how to fix the ship, but it's going to require the help of the engineers and the science officers. I guess I'll start this off by telling you how I've been feeling lately...  
(End dialogue)  

When I wake in the morning  
Feeling just like dirt  
I throw on my jumpsuit  
And get ready for work  

I'm just an inconsequential crewman  
Although I give it my best  
After days and days of working  
No one seems to know I exist  

Ah ya'll, ya'll there  
ya'll know what I'm saying - uh -
We don't get know love  

If you're from engineers  
Put your hands in the air  
For my engineers  
If you just don't care and you're engineers  
Put your hands in the air  
Engineers!! Engineersss!!!  
When I say engine, you say ears!  
Engine - eers. Engine - eers.  

Hands in the air for the medical  
Hands in the air for the medical  
I say medi- CAL medi-CAL!  

Well I got something to tell ya'll  
That you may not know  
Sometimes you matter more  
Than you think when you're living down here below  
On the lower decks  
Where they don't pay  
And they don't cash checks  
But you know what?  
You matter to me! So sing along!  

We're all consequential crewmen  
When it matters most  
Cuz without us, this ship would sink  
And the whole planet earth would be toast  

Because we're all consequential crewmen  
Throw your hands in the air with me if you agree  
And hug the person sitting next to you  
They might be the last one you ever see  

Yes we're all consequential crewmen  
You all do your jobs so well  
So get back to work immediately  
Before planet Earth goes to hell

## 6 SVC Theme Song

(Dialogue)  
Everyone. This is huge. We can see the planet in our long range sensors. Our readings indicate intelligent life with a 100% probability. The only strange thing is that there seems to be some sort of massive gravitational anomaly in the solar system approaching the planet.  

Nevertheless! Life! Amazing! This is true cause for celebration! As we finish the last leg of our arrival to ______, let us join together in singing the SVC anthem.  

(End dialogue)  

We are the SVC  
Space Venture Coalition  
We come through space  
And try to save the world  
For we know  
Outer space  
Is dangerous  

So we go  
Yes we seek  
Out in space   
Life and peace  
For we are the SVC  


## 7 Sad song about seeeing planet destroyed

(Dialogue)  
We're receiving a transmission! It appears to be coming from the planet!

(IN MY DREAMS MELODY AND SONG)

I used to dream  
Of life  
Beyond our reach  
I'd be learning  
All their stories  
In my dreams  
In my - my good dreams  

(verse about the end of a civilization)  

To all our dreams  
A horror  
Far beyond speech  
Gone in a blink  
Without warning  
But my dreams  
But my - my good -   

Dreams weren't ready  
For destruction  
So much terror  
So much nothing  

All our future  
Could be subject  
To a lifeform  
Far beyond us  

I used to dream  
Of life  
Beyond our reach  
I'd be learning  
All their stories  
In my dreams  
In my - my good dreams  

## 7 Distress signal from survivor / (they sing) Matrioshka Brain  


They built a matrioshka brain  
A super computer in space  

Eneveloped all the light and heat  
A heart inside, the sun it beats  

Inside. It beats. Inside. It beats.  

If you’ve ever seen the dark  
A brain like this might be parked  

Watching close and processing  
Any inputs, every little thing  

And this just in,  
One’s coming quick  

Propelled by  
The heat within    
The heat! WITHIN!!!!  
 
It’s coming quick!  
The matrioshka brain  

Can’t co-exist  
The matrioshka brain  

Verse  
I’ve heard of things like this before  
Crawling up from outer space’s core  

Some are cruel and some are generous  
This deep space monster wants to destroy us  

And we can’t float here idly by  
Letting Earth and every human die  

We  
MUST DEFEAT!!!!  

Life is a sensitive wonder  
It’s here and then it’s gone  
Heat and chemicals thunder  
We are all products of  
A sun  

A sun can give  
A sun can take  
This one’s bent on  
Earth’s destruction  
This one can’t stand life less bright  
Than a sun  
A sun  
And that’s us
