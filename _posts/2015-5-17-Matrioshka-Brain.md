ALL ON SECOND CAPO

(0-7)-(0-5)-(3-5)-(2-0) (verse)
They built a matrioshka brain  
A super computer in space  

(verse)  
Eneveloped all the light and heat  
A heart inside, the sun it beats  

F-G-A (Move all chords two frets up)  
-Whispered -  
Inside. It beats. Inside. It beats.  

If you’ve ever seen the dark  
A brain like this might be parked  

Watching close and processing  
Any inputs, every little thing  

F-G-A-Am  
And this just in,  
One’s coming quick  

F-G-A-Am  
Propelled by  
The heat within  
(f-open – g-open)    

A-G-C-D (chorus)  
It’s coming quick!  
The matrioshka brain  

Came to destroy us  
The matrioshka brain  

And your up next  
The Matrioshka brain  

It’s coming quick!  
The matrioshka brain  

Verse  
We'd heard of things like this before  
Crawling up from outer space’s core  

Some are cruel and some are generous  
This deep space monster came to destroy us  

And we just sat there watching while  
A mega structure filled up our sky  

Helpless  
It destroyed us    

A-G-C-D (chorus)  
It’s coming quick!  
The matrioshka brain  

Came to destroy us 
The matrioshka brain  

And your up next  
The Matrioshka brain  

It’s coming quick!  
The matrioshka brain  

(intro melody)
We need to find the queen  
To save your planet  
She rules the core  
Of the galaxy around us  

I have her coordinates  
I'll take you there  
The brain will follow us  
But don't be scared  

D-F-G-D-F-G-A
The brain will destroy life  
Life that can compete with it  
And you can travel faster than light  
So it is coming for you next  

(verse)  
They built a matrioshka brain  
Some ancient civilization  

Alive and complex just like you and me  
But wanting to control the galaxy  

And we can't float here idly by  
My home, then earth, then all of life  
Need  
The queen  

A-G-F-E (all these chords open and slower)  
Life is a sensitive wonder  
It’s here and then it’s gone  
Heat and chemicals thunder  
We are all products of  
The sun  

A sun can give  
A sun can take  
This one’s bent on  
Earth’s destruction  
This one can’t stand life as bright  
As a sun  
A sun  
And that’s us
