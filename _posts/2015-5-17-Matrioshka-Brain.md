(0-7)-(0-5)-(3-5)-(2-0) (verse)
They built a matrioshka brain  
A super computer in space  

(verse)  
Eneveloped all the light and heat  
A heart inside, the sun it beats  

F-G-A  
-Whispered -  
Inside. It beats. Inside. It beats.  

If you’ve ever seen the dark  
A brain like this might be parked  

Watching close and processing  
Any inputs, every little thing  

F-G-A-Am  
And this just in,  
One’s coming quick  

F-G-A-Am  
Propelled by  
The heat within  
(f-open – g-open)  
The heat! WITHIN!!!!  

A-G-C-D (chorus)  
It’s coming quick!  
The matrioshka brain  

Gonna destroy us  
The matrioshka brain  

Verse  
We'd heard of things like this before  
Crawling up from outer space’s core  

Some are cruel and some are generous  
This deep space monster came to destroy us  

And we just sat there watching while  
A great space monster from an endless sky  

Swept us  
From existence  

A-G-C-D (chorus)  
It’s coming quick!  
The matrioshka brain  

Gonna destroy us 
The matrioshka brain  

(intro melody)
We need to find the queen  
To save your planet  
She's rules the core
Of the galaxy around us

D-F-G-D-F-G-A
The brain will destroy
Life that can compete
And you can
Travel faster than light
And it won't stand for that



Talk about: Shkadov thruster, astroengineers, megastructures, dyson spheres,

A-G-F-E (all these chords open and slower)  
Life is a sensitive wonder  
It’s here and then it’s gone  
Heat and chemicals thunder  
We are all products of  
A sun  

A sun can give  
A sun can take  
This one’s bent on  
Earth’s destruction  
This one can’t stand life less bright  
Than a sun  
A sun  
And that’s us
