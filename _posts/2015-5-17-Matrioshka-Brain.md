(0-7)-(0-5)-(3-5)-(2-0) (verse)
They built a matrioshka brain  
A super computer in space  

(verse)  
Eneveloped all the light and heat  
A heart inside, the sun it beats  


F-G-A  
-Whispered -  
Inside. It beats. Inside. It beats.  

If you’ve ever seen the dark  
A brain like this might be parked  

Watching close and processing  
Any inputs, every little thing  

F-G-A-Am  
And this just in,  
One’s coming quick  

F-G-A-Am  
Propelled by  
The heat within  
(f-open – g-open)  
The heat! WITHIN!!!!  

A-G-C-D (chorus)  
It’s coming quick!  
The matrioshka brain  

Can’t co-exist  
The matrioshka brain  

Verse  
I’ve heard of things like this before  
Crawling up from outer space’s core  

Some are cruel and some are generous  
This deep space monster wants to destroy us  

And we can’t float here idly by  
Letting Earth and every human die  

We  
MUST DEFEAT!!!!  


Talk about: Shkadov thruster, astroengineers, megastructures, dyson spheres,

A-G-F-E (all these chords open and slower)  
Life is a sensitive wonder  
It’s here and then it’s gone  
Heat and chemicals thunder  
We are all products of  
A sun  

A sun can give  
A sun can take  
This one’s bent on  
Earth’s destruction  
This one can’t stand life less bright  
Than a sun  
A sun  
And that’s us
