We are the SVC  
Space Venture Coalition  
Exploring space  
We unify the world   
For we know  
Outer space  
Is beckoning  

So we go  
Yes we seek  
Other life   
Spreading peace  
For we are the SVC  




Space Venture Coalition, or SVC, began in 2015 as a simple Facebook group founded by Jared Clark Gay. But 20 years later, when Facebook became the government, Supreme Ruler Mark Zuckerberg replaced NASA with SVC as the global entity for bringing humanity to the stars. In doing so, he appointed Mr. Gay Chancellor of Space Exploration and Interstellar activities. Today, his great-great-great grandson is taking our world beyond any star system we're familiar with.

Here at SVC Academy, we prepare cadets to explore the space beyond with the 3 S's. Science. Silence. And sideburns (people in video turn to reveal cool spacey sideburns).
