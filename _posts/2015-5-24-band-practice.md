#Upcoming practice: 11/4/15  

Floating:  
Middle section - Transition into middle with Tom's keys, Tom plays lead single note along with me and Kyle playing bass, Second half has harmonized oOoOo's, Outro of section is "through the stars" 1, 2, BOOM.  

Last verse section - I play along, Lead descends as vocals do coordinated Ahhh's.  

Final part - Turn tremolo off


Matrioshka Brain:  
Intro - Figuring out what everyone is doing  
Verse 1 - I cut out, Tom plays whole not chords, Seb compliments, I come in at end part  
Verse 2 - Same as verse 1, but I play opening riff along  
Chorus 1 - Figure out how to transition back into verse 3 smoothly

1 - Sad Captain Song:  
This is sounding so cool. Just. Yeah. If we did it live like this I'd be mostly very happy. We should add in some harmonies. I could probably tighten some melodies. But I love the way the verse and chorus go, and I love what the drums transition into at 2:45ish. That whole outro, and the song in general, has such a great vibe. Also - the alternate matrioshka brain song at the end of this is killer.

2 - Launch:  
Not much new here. The only thing to note are the new transitions we came up with leading into the first and second choruses. We didn't quite get them right in this recording. But if you listen close, it might jog your memory. Sebastian keys are great.

3 - Matrioshka Brain:  
Something feels a little jarring about some of the transitions. We'll get it. ALSO - I'll be doing all I can to make the guitar not be so in your face. That should make more space for you keysmen to make the song truly excellent.
