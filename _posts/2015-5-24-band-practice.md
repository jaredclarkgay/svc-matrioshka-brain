Just listen through this once. These are the songs we'll be practicing.

1. Engine Failure (new version of Inconsequential Crewman) - fun "ahhhh" thing added.  
2. Queen Song (Alex may be coming to practice. Woohoo!)  
3. Mr. Brain (We have our brain, but he won't be coming tomorrow. I'll invite him for next week.)  
4. Battle song + Victory song (These kind of blend together, and we'll just be jamming them out.)  
5. List-a-mania  

Julianne is also coming, so we'll practice The Matrioshka Brain whenever she shows up.

IMPORTANT: Tracks take a little bit to load  

#### Liftoff:  
<audio controls>
<source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/audio/114-liftoff.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

1.  Lead in:  
  1. I like how everyone's kind of locked on the same notes, but Andrew has some moving stuff happening. Really effectively creates the feeling like we're about to break free from earth or whatevz.
  
2.  Main riff:  
  1. Andrew's guitar adds some excellent beef to the main riff. There's probably room for us to do some interesting stuff where it harmonizes a bit more.   
  
3. Tom:  
  1. I remember your keys having some flutey tone in another practice, and I loved it. It would happen at the end of verse sections to complement what I'd been singing. You're still doing something there that sounds great, but I have something specific you did that I loved. We can chat about it.  
  


#### Floating (starting at middle section):  
<audio controls>
<source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/audio/114-float-second-half.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

1. Final Breakdown:  
  1. Andrew and I play two phrases of the hard chords, I think Tom should play repeat quarter notes for the final two measures before it explodes.  
  2. I'd be thrilled if Kyle wrote a bass line mimicking the bass line in Chemtrails (by Beck). I'm talking about at the end of Chemtrails where the drum is doing endless fills and the bass rocks.  
  3. Might be cool to have Andrew doing a rich lead part that sounds something like what happens at the end of this the recording here: [Early recording of Floating](http://jaredclarkgay.github.io/svc-matrioshka-brain/All%20Songs/) <- I should also comment that this recording has lots of fun/potentially useable stuff.
  
2. Middle Section:  
  1. I love that the background voices sound like little floating angels that aren't super tightly locked. And I love how the background vocals do an escalation in the part between the final verse and the final breakdown.  

#### Sad Song:
<audio controls>
<source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/audio/114-sadsong.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

IMPORTANT: Start listening around 3:56 to not waste energy.  

1. First Chorus:  
  1. At the end of the first chorus, everyone in the band should do the breathy "ahh", not me.  
  2. Love Andrew's compliments in this section.
  
2. Verse:  
  1. Have Andrew do Oriental vibey stuff. He touches on it, and it sounds so good. I wonder if there's a way to tie it in well with the doo-wop vocals.  
  2. The doo-wop vocals are magnificent.  
  
3. Ending:
  1. I just need to figure out how exactly I want to do this part words/vocal wise.  
  
4. Loving Sebastian on the organ following my vocals.

#Upcoming practice: 11/4/15  

Floating:  
Middle section - Transition into middle with Tom's keys, Tom plays lead single note along with me and Kyle playing bass, Second half has harmonized oOoOo's, Outro of section is "through the stars" 1, 2, BOOM.  

Last verse section - I play along, Lead descends as vocals do coordinated Ahhh's.  

Final part - Turn tremolo off


Matrioshka Brain:  
Intro - Figuring out what everyone is doing  
Verse 1 - I cut out, Tom plays whole not chords, Seb compliments, I come in at end part  
Verse 2 - Same as verse 1, but I play opening riff along  
Chorus 1 - Figure out how to transition back into verse 3 smoothly


#Most recent update: 10/22/15  

1 - Sad Captain Song:  
This is sounding so cool. Just. Yeah. If we did it live like this I'd be mostly very happy. We should add in some harmonies. I could probably tighten some melodies. But I love the way the verse and chorus go, and I love what the drums transition into at 2:45ish. That whole outro, and the song in general, has such a great vibe. Also - the alternate matrioshka brain song at the end of this is killer.

2 - Launch:  
Not much new here. The only thing to note are the new transitions we came up with leading into the first and second choruses. We didn't quite get them right in this recording. But if you listen close, it might jog your memory. Sebastian keys are great.

3 - Matrioshka Brain:  
Something feels a little jarring about some of the transitions. We'll get it. ALSO - I'll be doing all I can to make the guitar not be so in your face. That should make more space for you keysmen to make the song truly excellent.

4 - SVC Anthem:
