- Tom breaks grip of the brain  
- We RUN
- The brain catchs up and main riff is when he gets us in his tractor beam
- then quiet muted "I thank all good things, for my friends and my enemies" riff
- Then queen shows up to destroy him and "THIS TIIIIME!!!" part plays
- They duke it out for a minute, we get our distance
- Brain explodes  







Here we stand  
At the edge of space and man  
All we can see  
Is the Matrioshka Brain  

It’s terrible to define  
All the fear I feel inside  
But we’ve got a queen  
Defending human kind
