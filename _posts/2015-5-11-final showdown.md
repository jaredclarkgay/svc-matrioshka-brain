- Tom breaks grip of the brain  
- We RUN
- The brain catches up and main riff is when he gets us in his tractor beam
- then quiet muted "I thank all good things, for my friends and my enemies" riff
- Then queen shows up to destroy him and "THIS TIIIIME!!!" part plays
- They duke it out for a minute, we get our distance
- Brain explodes  


Am-G-Em-D-F-C-D  
Here we stand  
At the edge of space and man  
All we can see  
Is the Matrioshka Brain  

Am-G-Em-D-F-C-D  
It’s terrible to describe  
All the fear I feel inside  
But we’ve got a queen  
Defending human kind  

Will she come  
To send the brain super nova?  
All we can do  
Is run  
Is run  

Tom - Captain, he's gotten too close. His gravity well is sucking us in. We don't have the power to get out.  

Am-D-Em-D
It's too late for you now  
You can't escape  
First I'll destroy you  
and then your whole race  

Too smart for your good  
You've wasted your time  
And now it's the end  
Here's the real goodbye  

Goodbye! Goodbye!

Captain - Wait. She's here.
Queen - Captain - engage your engines, I'll help power your ship out of here. He's about to go super nova.
Matrioshka Brain - Mother. It's you.

(guitar hook)  

Brain:  
Life is a sensitive wonder.  
It's here, and then it's gone.  

(Explosion sequence)
