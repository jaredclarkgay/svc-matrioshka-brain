(Eb-G-C)  
(Eb-Bb-Dm-Eb)  
I used to dream  
Of life  
Beyond our reach  
I'd be learning  
All their stories  
In my dreams  
In my - my good dreams  

(verse about the end of a civilization)  

(Eb-G-C)  
(Eb-Bb-Dm-Eb)  
To all our dreams  
A horror  
Far beyond speech  
Gone in a blink  
Without warning  
But my dreams  
But my - my good -   

(Eb-Bb-C-Eb-F)  
Dreams weren't ready  
For destruction  
So much terror  
So much nothing  

All our future  
Could be subject  
To a lifeform  
Far beyond us  

(Eb-Bb-C-Eb-F)  
Can't phone home  
Can't bridge the distance  
So much life  
Gone in an instant  
Wish we could have had just  
One more moment  
One more moment  
One more moment  

I used to dream  
Of life  
Beyond our reach  
I'd be learning  
All their stories  
In my dreams  
In my - my good dreams  


Story of how captain became a space explorer because he loves life so destroying the Matrioshka brain is terrifying, but he knows it needs to be done.

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
I  
Came here  
To find  
Life  

C-B-A-C-B-A-G-F-E  
And sometimes life brings  
Unexpected fights  
Cuz life wants to survive  

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
Why  
does life  
need so much  
light?  

And why  
Is space  
Such  
an endless night?  

Captain on the line  
I wanna tell you about my youth  

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
I used to study  
Study the sky  

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
Used to stare up late  
Wondering why  

F-E-F-G  
The stars in the sky  
Hung there all night  

F-E-F-G  
And I've wondered what the universe is for  
All my life  
And I'm still not sure  
But I know I love life
