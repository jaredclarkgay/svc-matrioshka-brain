title: 8) Captain's Log

- Jared: Tom, get us out of here as fast and far as you can. -  
- Tom: Engines engaged, captain. -
- Jared: Captain's Log: I can't believe it. My greatest dream was just crushed before my eyes, and apparently that thing is coming to destroy us, and Earth next. Worst of all, I have no idea how we're going to find this Space Queen who can supposedly save us. -

Oh endless night  
I try, and I try  
And I cannot  
see any light  

I looked outside  
And saw so much life  
Split from its day  
Forever to its night

When I was just a boy  
I dreamed of outerspace and I  
guess that I just dreamt too bright  

When I was just a boy  
I dreamed of life in space  
I hoped that I would find others like me  

My greatest dream  
Gone in a blink  
Curious, like us,  
But quickly extinct  

I am afraid  
We are alone  
Space may not be  
Our home

When I was just a boy  
I dreamed of outerspace and I  
guess that I just dreamt too bright  

When I was just a boy  
I dreamed of life in space  
I hoped that I would find others like me  

Like me, like me, like me, like me, like me, like me, like me,

I hoped that I would find,  
I hoped that I would find!  
I hoped that I would find others like me,  

Like me, like me, like me, like me, like me
