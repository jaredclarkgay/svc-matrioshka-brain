A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
I  
Came here  
To find  
Life  

C-B-A-C-B-A-G-F-E  
And sometimes life brings  
Unexpected fights  
Cuz life wants to survive  

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
Why  
does life  
need so much  
light?  

And why  
Is space  
Such  
an endless night?  

(Monologue about the value of life and feeling really torn about having to destroy the Matrioshka brain - even though it's artificial intelligence, it's definitely alive etc. When I was just a boy I learned to value life or something dumb like that. Maybe there's an alternate solution?)
