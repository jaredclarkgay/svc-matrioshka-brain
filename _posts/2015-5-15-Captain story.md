Oh endless night  
I try, and I try  
And I cannot  
see any light  

I looked outside  
And saw so much life  
Split from its day  
Forever to its night  

G#-A#-C
When I was just a boy  
I dreamed of outerspace and I  
guess that I just dreamt too bright  

When I was just a boy  
I dreamed of life in space  
I hoped that I would find others like me  

My greatest dream  
Gone in a blink  
Curious, like us,  
But quickly extinct  

I am afraid  
What was that thing?  
How do we find  
The space queen?  

G#-A#-C
When I was just a boy  
I dreamed of outerspace and I  
guess I dreamt too bright  

When I was just a boy  
I dreamed of life in space  
I hoped that I would find others like me

Better monologue (maybe) and some fun post-monologue stuff

(Eb-G-C)  
(Eb-Bb-Dm-Eb)  
I used to dream  
Of life  
Beyond our reach  
I'd be learning  
All their stories  
In my dreams  
In my - my good dreams  

(verse about the end of a civilization)  

(Eb-G-C)  
(Eb-Bb-Dm-Eb)  
To all our dreams  
A horror  
Beyond speech  
Gone in a blink  
Without warning  
All my dreams    

(Bb-Dm-G#-Eb)  
Goodbye  
Goodnight  
Will I see you in the morning  
Is this a dream   

So brief  
So bright  
Don't think I'll see you in the morning  
You will not be returning  

(Eb-Bb-C-Eb-F)  
Dreams weren't ready  
For destruction  
So much terror  
So much nothing  

All our future  
Could be subject  
To a lifeform  
Far beyond us  

(Eb-Bb-C-Eb-F)  
Can't call home  
Can't bridge the distance  
So much life  
Gone in an instant  
Wish we could have  
Has just one more  
One more moment  
One more moment  

I used to dream  
Of life  
Beyond our reach  
I'd be learning  
All their stories  
In my dreams  
In my - my good dreams

Story of how captain became a space explorer because he loves life so destroying the Matrioshka brain is terrifying, but he knows it needs to be done.

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
I  
Came here  
To find  
Life  

C-B-A-C-B-A-G-F-E  
And sometimes life brings  
Unexpected fights  
Cuz life wants to survive  

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
Why  
does life  
need so much  
light?  

And why  
Is space  
Such  
an endless night?  

Captain on the line  
I wanna tell you about my youth  

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
I used to study  
Study the sky  

A-D-Dm-A-Em-D  
Used to stare up late  
Wondering why  

F-E-F-G  
The stars in the sky  
Hung there all night  

F-E-F-G  
And I've wondered what the universe is for  
All my life  
And I'm still not sure  
But I know I love life
