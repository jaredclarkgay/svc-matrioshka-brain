Andrew riff -
F-Am-Bb-A-Bb-A-G
Star dust  
Left behind  
Earth is safe  
We came  
and found some life  

Star dust  
Left behind  
Earth is safe  
We came
and ended some life  

- Me ask the Queen - The brain really had to go didn't he. I mean he predicted we'd kill him, and that's exactly what we did.  
- Queen - Listen - there was no way he was going to let humanity survive.  
- Me - I just wonder if there might have been some other solution.  
- Queen - You may never know, and you may never stop wondering, but there's a whole galaxy full of life waiting for you, and you're not getting any younger.  
- Me - Full of life like us?  
- Queen - Very much so. Whatever happens next is up to you.

I look to the sky  
And I see it's all bright  

And we are alive    

What, what did we find?  
A queen, a brain,  
an alien survives  
And soon we will arrive  
Alive  

Whatever lies ahead!  
Our newest beginning!  
Nothing will be quite the same!  
Will something be ending?  

I've got my doubts!  
I've got my trust!  
We found some life!  
like  
us!  

Whatever lies ahead!

A-F-C-D  
We found life  

A-F-C-G-D  
Here in outer space     

A-F-C-G-D  
Like we hoped, through our doubts  

Dm-C-G-F  
No more doubts, no more doubts, no more doubts  

A-C-D  
No more doubts, no more doubts, no more doubts  

A-F-C-D  
And I'm thinking about  

A-F-C-D  
My family and my friends    

A-F-C-G-D  
So let's turn back, and let'em know  

Dm-C-G-F  
What we found, what we found, what we found  

A-C-D  
What we found, what we found, what we found    

A-Dm-F-G  
I know there's life out there like me  
I've seen it in our galaxy
I came to reach beyond the stars  
Right here is where the future starts
