Andrew riff -
F-Fmaj7-Bb-A-Bb-A-G
Star dust  
Left behind  
Earth is safe  
We came  
and found some life  

Star dust  
Left behind  
Earth is safe  
We came
and ended some life  

- Me ask the Queen - Did we do the right thing? I mean he was definitely evil, but we did kill him. Like he predicted.  
- Queen - You may never know, but there's a whole galaxy full of life waiting for you, and you're not getting any younger.
- Me - Life like us?
- Queen - Very much so. Whatever happens next is up to you.   

A-F-C-D  
We found life  

A-F-C-G-D  
Here in outer space     

A-F-C-G-D  
Like we hoped, through our doubts  

Dm-C-G-F  
No more doubts, no more doubts, no more doubts  

A-C-D  
No more doubts, no more doubts, no more doubts  

A-F-C-D  
And I'm thinking about  

A-F-C-D  
My family and my friends    

A-F-C-G-D  
So let's turn back, and let'em know  

Dm-C-G-F  
What we found, what we found, what we found  

A-C-D  
What we found, what we found, what we found    

A-Dm-F-G  
I know there's life out there like me  
I've seen it in our galaxy
I came to reach beyond the stars  
Right here is where the future starts
