I'm the brain  
You're the fools  
You don't even make good tools  

And you, stepped outside  
Welcome, welcome to the skies  

Nice to meet you  
The pleasure is mine  
Here to wipe you  
from space and time  
Sit back  
Enjoy the ride  
Sweet little earthlings  
About to die  

Let me tell you a little bit about my self  

E-C#m-D-A
Let me tell you about myself
There's a star inside me  

Powering the smartest being
Ever in existence

Nothing out there's quite like me  
And I hate competition  

Why should I let you live?  
And risk my own destruction?
