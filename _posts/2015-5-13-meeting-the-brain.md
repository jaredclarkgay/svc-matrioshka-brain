E-D-C#m  
Here you are  
Seeking life - on this  
Intergalactic space flight  

Yeah you - stepped outside  
Welcome, welcome to the skies  

Nice to meet you  
The pleasure is mine  
Here to wipe you  
from space and time, so just  
Sit back  
Enjoy the ride  
Sweet little earthlings  
About to die  

B-D-A-E
Let  
Me tell you  
A little bit about myself  
My story  

There's  
A star inside me
It powers all my
Circuits and memory 

You
Are one of many
To reach the place
Where you might try to kill me

D-A-E  
And I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  

(Final verse) - should we double this?  
Who are you to say exactly what is alive?  
Organic or mechanical just one can survive  
I wanna live  
By myself  
Out in space  
No one else  

B-D-A-E
Let  
Me tell you  
A little bit about myself  
My story  

There's  
A star inside me
It powers all my
Circuits and memory 

You
Are one of many
To reach the place
Where you might try to kill me

D-A-E  
And I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  

D-A-E  
And I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die (a bunch of times)  

D-A  
So goodbye  
My human friends  

E-D  
Human-kind  
It's the end  

D-A  
Goodbye my human friends 

(main riff)  
Goodbye!!  


____________________________

Could be today  
Or a thousand years  
Light speed travelers  
Know too much fear  

And I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die (twice)  

something about the queen  

Powering the smartest being
Ever in existence

Nothing out there's quite like me  
And I hate competition  

Why should I let you live?  
And risk my own destruction?  

And I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  

I shall run the sky
I will make you fry
I don't want to die
so i must make you die


You  
Say you'll leave me be  
But I know better  
Than to trust organic beings  

True
You're nice
But someday  
You'll take my life, you'll take my life, you'll take my life  

I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  
I don't wanna die  

Ever ever ever ever
