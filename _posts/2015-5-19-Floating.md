This recording is a straight up pirated recording of a song of Colin's.

It's probably not even close to what the vibe of this song should be. But this song should feel nice. Breathing room. It's space. It's nice. It's new. It's expansive, and it isn't dark like most everything else in this show will be.

Em7-F-C-F-Em7
Tell me when your heads  
Have regained some balance and 

Your eyes are open again  
Lots of stars ahead  

Em7-A-Em7-A  
Now we're floating  
Away from home and  
F-C-F-C-E  
It's hard out in space
To know if we're
alone

Em7-F-C-F-Em7
Look out your window and  
Look at your neighbor and  
You'll be wonderin' if we're
Really alone up here  

Em7-A-Em7-A  
And time will slide  
Earth may die  
F-C-F-C-E  
Infinity  
Will watch it  
All pass by  

Em7-F-C-F-Em7
Don't hold your breath
There's  oxygen on this ship

Where we're going out here
I'm not sure yet 

Em7-A-Em7-A  
But we're floating  
Away from home and  
F-C-F-C-E  
It's hard out in space
To know if we're
alone
