A(open-f-shape-)-A(e-shape open)-(007870)-(000433)  
I see the space in front of me  
Through some glass a few feet deep  

Days go by it looks the same  
Each passing star a nameless grain  

I keep a picture within reach  
of my friends and family  
I wonder what they're wondering  
As I float through the spacey deep  

Dm-C#-C-F-E

G-F-A-G-F-A  
[C/G-D/G(c-shape)-B/F#(c-shape)  ]
Don’t be alarmed  
The space isn’t so far  
Between  
Point A  
And Point B  
I came here to reach beyond our  
Earth and through the stars  
(Dm-C#-C-G-F-G-F) maybe  
We came here to reach beyond our  
Earth and through the stars  

A(open-f-shape-)-A(e-shape open)-(007870)-(000433)  
I won't ever see  
Things the way they used to be  
We're the first to take this leap  
Deep into the galaxy  

A-Dm-F-G
I am wonderin’ what we’ll see  
I hope there’s life out there like me

Tell me when your heads  
Have regained some balance and 

Your eyes are open again  
Lots of stars ahead  

Em7-A-Em7-A  
Now we're floating  
Away from home and  
F-C-F-C-E  
It's hard out in space
To know if we're
alone

Em7-F-C-F-Em7
Look out your window and  
Look at your neighbor and  
You'll be wonderin' if we're
Really alone up here  

Em7-A-Em7-A  
And time will slide  
Earth may die  
F-C-F-C-E  
Infinity  
Will watch it  
All pass by  

Em7-F-C-F-Em7
Don't hold your breath
There's   oxygen on this ship

Where we're going out here
I'm not sure yet 

Em7-A-Em7-A  
But we're floating  
Away from home and  
F-C-F-C-E  
It's hard out in space
To know if we're
alone
