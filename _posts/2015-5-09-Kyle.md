Hey Kyle, Here are the pertinent tracks right now with a lil bit of info for you.  

1 - The takeoff song has the bass turned up for you listening and learning pleasure.

2 - The Matrioshka Brain track isn't short, but all the parts are there. It's definitely subject to some minor change, but I think it's the best current iteration. I also imagine this being sung by a girl who is pissed and full of rage and terror because her planet was just destroyed.

3 - Here's a practice version of the floating song. It needs some work with transitions and flow, but all the parts are here.
