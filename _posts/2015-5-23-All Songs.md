1 - Boarding:  
Everyone gets on the ship. Fun. We're going to check out a planet named Zuckerberg we suspect has life on it. We're in the year 2215. We haven't found life off of Earth yet. So please, Zuckerberg, have life! It's our dream!

2 - Liftoff:  
Here we go. Say goodbye. We're bursting through the atmosphere. Onward to Zuckerberg faster than the speed of light. Is life out there? Are we going to find it?

3 - Floating:  
We float. We wonder. The trip is long. Our collective future is changing.

4 - Inconsequential Crewman:  
The ship breaks down. Tom has the solution, but first he wants to sing about how he's been feeling.

5 - Maximum Warp:  
We zip back into maximum warp once Tom plugs the engine back in. Here we come, Zuckerberg.

6 - SVC Theme Song:  
Upon detecting intelligent life on Zuckerberg we celebrate with a rousing chorus of the SVC Theme Song. The theme song is interrupted by a transmission from the planet. We're excited, and the person speaking to us is also excited - but not about the discovery of life.

7 - Xenocide:  
We just saw Zuckerberg be devoured by the Matrioshka Brain and were told to "Flee!" "Find the Space Queen!" "If you're here, it already knows you exist and will destroy your planet!". In summary, our dreams were simultaneously fulfilled and shattered. Life and destruction all at once. Reflection. Introspection. Growing up. Also - what exactly was that thing?

8 - Matrioshka Brain:  
A distress signal comes in from the sole survivor of Zuckerberg. Apparently that thing is called The Matrioshka Brain. It destroys life intelligent enough to travel faster than the speed of light. The space queen can help us stop it. The surviving Zuckerberger has the queen's coordinates and will help us find her.

9 - Space Queen:  
The Space Queen, after a regal and truly awesome entrance, agrees to help us stop the brain to protect the galaxy core, i.e. her turf. She boards our ship to act as bait and to help us trick the brain into overconsumption as it chases us.

10 - Final Battle:  
We trick the brain into eating too much shiz. It eats a bunch of planets in our pursuit, and finally it tries to eat a small star and goes supernova. The entire brain combusts as the star inside it explodes. Good. Right?
