Intro:  
C(slide to)-D  
Am-G-C-C(slide to)-D


A-G  
Earth  
You summoned me  
I reign over everything  
I make life, I make death  
Iâ€™ve decided you should live  
   
I will take control  
Save your bodies, save your souls  
You might be new to outer space but  
I know how to kill the brain  
 
I know how and I have come to

Em-D  
Save you!
Em-D  
Save you all!  
F#m-G-F#m-G (Repeat)    
  
Before life was here  
I needed to chart all the spheres  
I used a star to build The Brain  
Was loyal til it turned on me  
 
Earth  
You're only one  
Every planet has its sun  
We must launch a full attack  
Before more planets meet their match   
I am here and I have to come
to save you! Save you all!    
A    
Listen closely  
I need a decoy  
I need you to distract The Brain  
While I summon the power to destroy it  
   
It shouldn't take too long. No.  
It shouldn't take tooo long. No.  
It shouldn't take toooo long go go go go go go!  

C-D

Captain:  
A
You heard the Queen  
A-C-G (notes)  
We must be brave and get in the way  
Of the brain  
We've got to distract him  
Lead him deep into space  
A-C-G     
We'll have to fight him until the Queen can blow  him away  
   
Who's ready for battle?  
Band: I'm ready for battle!  

A-F-B-G#-A
E-C-F#-D#-E (power chords by necessity)  








The recording is an idea that ushers in her spacey royalness. The first part of the song   summons the Queen with crowd participation. Should all be regal.  






(These lyrics below are for the captain to sing before the Queen is summoned in - don't match the recording.)
We're absolutely screwed I think    
I bare no shame to admit defeat    
And there is nothing we can do  
To save the Earth for me and you  

It looks as though we need a Space Queen  
A woman who can save our species  
Please send a Space Queen  
Please send a Space Queen  
Please send a Space Queen  

Is there anyone out there?  
Who cares or even is aware?  
Please send a Space Queen  
Please send a Space Queen
