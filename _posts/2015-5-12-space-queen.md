The recording is an idea that ushers in her spacey royalness. The first part of the song summons the Queen with crowd participation. Should all be regal.

(These lyrics below are for the captain to sing before the Queen is summoned in - don't match the recording.)
We're absolutely screwed I think  
I bare no shame to admit defeat  
And there is nothing we can do  
To save the Earth for me and you  

It looks as though we need a Space Queen  
A woman who can save our species  
Please send a Space Queen  
Please send a Space Queen  
Please send a Space Queen  

Is there anyone out there?  
Who cares or even is aware?  
Please send a Space Queen  
Please send a Space Queen
